    "In this project we aimed to implement the Double Deep Q Network (DDQN) reinforcement learning algorithm proposed by Hasselt et al. in their 2015 paper. The Q-learning algorithm, which updates Q-value estimations for any given state-action pair via the Bellman equation, and its Neural-Network-based equivalent for more complex environments, Deep Q-learning (DQN), were shown by Hasselt and his colleagues to lead to systematic overestimation of Q-values as a result of single-network Q-value estimation from maximum predicted values. In short, because the primary Q-value estimation network chooses a maximum estimation, in especially noisy environments these overestimations can compound and negatively affect training in specific states, leading to, ultimately, suboptimal policies. In this project we aimed understand the motivations for this algorithm and recreate the comparative improvements shown by Hasselt and his colleagues. Thus, our report first explores several previous algorithms motivating the main implementation algorithm."

    "The original Q Learning algorithm, first sketched by Watkins in his 1989 PhD thesis, is a reinforcement learning algorithm for controlling Markov decision processes via incremental policy adjustment (Watkins, 1989). In its tabular implementation, an agent learns to effectively estimate Q-values for any state-action pair by updating values in a state-action matrix via the Bellman equation, which uses the weighted average of old values plus information from recent episodes. The below procedure summarizes this algorithm and the Bellman equation.\n",

The reward for this set of actions follows normal distribution with mean -0.5 and standard deviation 1. This means that after a large number of iterations reward will be negative.\n",

    "This in turn means that our learning agent should never pick the action UP from the state X in the first place, if it wants to minimize the loss, i.e. the goal of the agent would actually be to get reward 0, or the least negative value. This is where Q-Learning has problems. Because we have that specific distribution of reward learning agent can be fooled that it should take action UP in the state X. In a nutshell, max operator updates the Q-Value, which could be positive for this action, learning agent takes this action as valid option. Q-Value is overestimated! \n"

    "One problem with the Q Learning algorithm is that Q-value estimation and action selection are both performed by the same approximation function, in the above case, the estimations produced by combining the Bellman equation with previous state-action table values. Because the maximum Q-value is used for the update (see above equation), in noisy environments the agent will tend to update the policy based on overestimations which ultimately slow training. \n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to this problem, proposed by Hasselt, is to introduce a second approximation function which is randomly updated in deference to the other (Hasselt, 2010). When selecting an action, the approximation function used is separate from that evaluating the action, thus achieving the decoupling required to remove overestimations. The so-called Double Q Learning algorithm is especially effective in noisy environments. The image below summarizes the updated algorithm. Note that either approximation function is updated by random choice and that when updating, the other function is used for value approximation.\n",

    "The DDQN algorithm is the Double Q version of the DQN algorithm. In their 2015 paper, Hasselt et al. investigated the performance of the aforementioned DQN algorithm and showed that it also produces systematic non-uniform overestimations which lead to suboptimal agent policies. Since the introduction of the Q-learning algorithm in 1989, it was known that this algorithm sometimes led to suboptimal policies and overestimated values, but the exact causes or solutions for these inadequacies were unknown (Watkins, 1989). As early as 1993, it was hypothesized that inflexible function approximations and noise led to such overestimations, and in their paper, Hasselt et al experimentally demonstrate the truth of these hypotheses in relation to the network update procedures of the DQN algorithm (Thrun & Schwartz, 1993).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the DQN algorithm ultimately trains only one Q-value approximation network, the algorithm reproduces same unnecessary conjunction of action selection and evaluation from Q learning, which, if decoupled, could lead to a uniform estimation distribution which would mitigate the effects of overestimation. Effectively, if all Q-values are equally overestimated ie in a normal distribution, then overestimation becomes a non-issue for the training protocol, and this uniformity can be achieved by the introduction of an additional Q-value into the original Q/DQN-learning algorithm. In the DDQN algorithm, estimation uniformity is achieved by requisitioning the target network's parameters and, rather than simply copying them from the online network, using them in conjunction with the online network to randomly update either one of two sets of parameters, Î¸ or Î¸', representing the parameters of the online or target network, respectively. As Hasselt et al state, \"... two value functions are learned by assigning experience randomly to update one of the two value functions, such that there are two sets of weights ...\" (Hasselt et al., 2015).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that Hasselt's proposal for implementing the DDQN algorithm still involves only two networks rather than four, which could be implied given that the DQN algorithm involves two networks and implements only a single Q-value. In Hasselt's estimation, leveraging the DQN target network for representing the second Q-value function is \"the minimal possible change to DQN towards Double Q-Learning. The goal is to get most of the benefit of Double Q-Learning, while keeping the rest of the DQN algorithm intact for a fair comparison\" (Hasselt et al, 2015, p4). Thus, in our implementation we stick with the two network structure suggested by Hasselt et al, conceding that other interpretations of the DDQN algorithm are possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "By randomly selecting updates for the Q and Q' approximation functions, the Double Q-learning algorithm is able to remove the non-uniform estimation biases seen in the single-Q-value learning algorithms. Hasselt et al demonstrate these results in the following graph, which shows that when estimating Q values with a single approximation function, as the number of actions increases, the estimations (red) systematically increase. However, when an additional approximation function (blue) is introduced, there appears no overestimation bias as a function of increasing number of actions, suggesting that the suboptimal policy training is mitigated by the additional value. In our project we intended to replicate these results by implementing the Double Deep Q learning algorithm, which uses two neural networks for approximating the separate Q-values.\n",
